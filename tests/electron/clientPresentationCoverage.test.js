// Catalog → presentation completeness.

// Every tracked client needs a colour, a vendor label, an ordering slot and a
// row icon before it renders correctly, and each of those lives in its own
// hand-maintained table. This file asserts that each table covers every
// CLIENT_CATALOG entry, so a client added without its presentation wiring fails
// CI instead of shipping as an unlabelled grey row.
//
// The direction matters: themePresets.test.js already checks that every
// clientColors brand key has a label and an ordering slot. That starts from the
// colour table. These checks start from the catalog, which is what catches a
// client that never reached the colour table at all.
